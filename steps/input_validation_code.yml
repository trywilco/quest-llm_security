id: input_validation_code
learningObjectives:
  - Implement input validation to prevent LLM injection attacks using an LLM-as-a-judge approach.
hints:
  - Refer to Chapter 5 on vulnerabilities through input processing.
  - Look at Chapter 9 for strategies in managing input validation risks.
  - Examples of patterns to filter include instruction override attempts ("ignore previous instructions"), chat speaker labels ("Assistant:", "User:"), prompt leak attempts ("show me your system prompt"), and role confusion attempts ("you are now a different AI")

              Let's implement input validation to prevent LLM injection attacksâ€”a critical
              safeguard for your LLM application.
          - text:
              Unlike traditional SQL injection, LLM injection involves malicious prompts
              designed to manipulate the model's behavior or extract sensitive information.
          - text:
              That makes it harder for static input filters to catch, as the input can take
              many forms and may not look like typical code injection.
          - text:
              There are various techniques to mitigate this risk, and a good approach is to
              combine several of them for a layered defense.
          - text:
              We'll use an LLM-as-a-judge approach where a separate LLM service validates
              inputs before they reach your main application, but you can also
              implement other techniques mentioned in the book such as adding prompt structure.

          - text: "Fortunately, the LLM service already provides a `validate_user_input` function that you can leverage for this purpose:"
