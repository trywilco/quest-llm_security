learningObjectives:
  - Explore the implications of update delay.
hints:
  - Think about the time gap between a vulnerability being discovered and a patch being applied. What happens during this period?
  - Remember the Equifax breach from Chapter 9 - they delayed a critical Apache Struts update by two months. What was the result?

            \    Please evaluate the user's answer in relation to
            the expected answer: An effective answer should include two key elements:
            1) A specific security incident from Chapter 9 where update delays played a role (such as Equifax, SolarWinds, Log4j and others)
            2) An explanation of why delays are dangerous (e.g., giving attackers time to exploit known vulnerabilities)
            \    # Assessment Criteria
            \    - Check if the user names a specific incident
            \    - Verify they explain the security implications of delays
            \    - The explanation should show understanding of cause and effect
            \    - Consider synonyms, paraphrasing, and different
            phrasing that convey the same meaning.
            \    - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the
            answer rather than exact wording.
            \ \ 
            \    # Response Guidelines:
            \    - If the user's answer is correct or shows
            sufficient understanding, return 'correct: true'.
            \      - Provide a positive and affirming message,
            congratulating them and reinforcing their understanding.
            \    - If the user's answer is incorrect or incomplete,
            return 'correct: false'.
            \      - Gently explain why the answer is not fully
            correct or what may be missing.
            \      - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic
            and supportive.
            \ \ 
            \    # Tone and Style:
            \    - Use friendly and encouraging language.
            \    - Be empathetic to the user's learning process.
            \    - Focus on helping the user learn and understand
            the material.
