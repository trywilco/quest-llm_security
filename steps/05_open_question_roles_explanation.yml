learningObjectives:
  - Understand risks of unsafe training data and data provenance tracking.
hints:
  - Think about what happens when popular training datasets contain inappropriate or harmful content.
  - Consider the Stanford research on LAION-5B dataset mentioned in Chapter 9.
  - Remember that organizations may not know what's in their training data if they haven't documented it properly.

            \    Please evaluate the user's answer in relation to
            the expected answer: An effective answer should include two key elements:
            1) An explanation of why organizations must track training data sources (e.g., to identify exposure to harmful content, comply with regulations, enable rapid response when issues are discovered, understand model capabilities and limitations)
            2) Steps to take when unsafe content is discovered (e.g., assess impact on trained models, determine if models need retraining, notify stakeholders, implement additional safeguards, audit other datasets, document the incident)
            \    # Assessment Criteria
            \    - Check if the user understands the importance of training data provenance and tracking
            \    - Verify they explain the risks of not knowing what's in training datasets
            \    - Look for mention of concrete remediation steps when unsafe content is found
            \    - The explanation should show understanding of LLM-specific data governance challenges
            \    - Consider synonyms, paraphrasing, and different
            phrasing that convey the same meaning.
            \    - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the
            answer rather than exact wording.
            \ \
            \    # Response Guidelines:
            \    - If the user's answer is correct or shows
            sufficient understanding, return 'correct: true'.
            \      - Provide a positive and affirming message,
            congratulating them and reinforcing their understanding.
            \    - If the user's answer is incorrect or incomplete,
            return 'correct: false'.
            \      - Gently explain why the answer is not fully
            correct or what may be missing.
            \      - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic
            and supportive.
            \ \
            \    # Tone and Style:
            \    - Use friendly and encouraging language.
            \    - Be empathetic to the user's learning process.
            \    - Focus on helping the user learn and understand
            the material.
